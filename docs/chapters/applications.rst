C++ in Jupyter Notebook - Xeus Cling

The Jupyter Notebook technology allows users to create and share documents that
contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It enables data
scientists to easily exchange ideas or collaborate by sharing their analyses in
a straight-forward and reproducible way.Jupyter’s official C++ kernel
(Xeus-Cling) relies on Xeus, a C++ implementation of the kernel protocol, and
Cling.  Using C++ in the Jupyter environment yields a different experience to
C++ users. For example, Jupyter’s visualization system can be used to render
rich content such as images, therefore bringing more interactivity into the
Jupyter’s world.


Interactive CUDA C++ with Cling 

The Cling CUDA extension brings the workflows of interactive C++ to GPUs,
without losing performance and compatibility to existing software.  Through this
extension, C++ and CUDA can be used interactively on the target machine,
allowing for optimization for particular models of accelerator hardware. The
extension can be run on a Jupyter setup. Cling CUDA found application in the
field of modeling of high-energy particles and radiation produced by high-energy
laser facilities. In this framework, Cling CUDA allows for an interactive
approach which enables relaunching only a wanted part of a simulation, starting
from a given point which can be decided by the user.
