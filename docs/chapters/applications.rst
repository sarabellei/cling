Applications
------------------------------------


1. C++ in Jupyter Notebook - Xeus Cling

The Jupyter Notebook technology allows users to create and share documents that
contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It enables data
scientists to easily exchange ideas or collaborate by sharing their analyses in
a straight-forward and reproducible way.Jupyter’s official C++ kernel
(Xeus-Cling) relies on Xeus, a C++ implementation of the kernel protocol, and
Cling.  Using C++ in the Jupyter environment yields a different experience to
C++ users. For example, Jupyter’s visualization system can be used to render
rich content such as images, therefore bringing more interactivity into the
Jupyter’s world.


2. Interactive CUDA C++ with Cling

CUDA is a platform and Application Programming Interface (API) created by NVIDIA. It controls GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) for parallel programming,  enabling developers to harness the power of graphic processing units (GPUs) to speed up applications. As an example, PIConGPU is a CUDA-based plasma      physics application to solve the dynamics of a plasma by computing the motion of electrons and ions in the plasma field. 
Interactive GPU programming was made possible by extending Cling functionality to compile CUDA C++ code. The new Cling-CUDA C++ can be used on Jupyter Notebook platform, and enables big, interactive simulation with GPUs, easy GPU development and debugging, and effective GPU programming learning.
